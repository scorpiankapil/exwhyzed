<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Founded in 1995, Little Bakery started as a small family-run shop. Over the years, we've mastered artisan breads, croissants, and seasonal pastries. Each recipe is a story handed down through generations. Our customers love the warm, cozy environment where everyone feels like family. Come by for a cup of coffee and a fresh pastry!</p>
